## Intro

The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, are regarded as one of the most significant and prestigious awards in the entertainment industry. The awards are an international recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements, as assessed by the Academy's voting membership. 

The Academy Award for Best Picture is one of the Academy Awards presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). Best Picture is usually the final award of the night and is considered the most prestigious honor of the ceremony.

But what are the factors that could increase your chances to win the award for Best Picture? That's what we're here to find out.


## Motivation

When lockdown came into effect the movie industry was one of those that took a punch to the gut. With theaters closing and movies stopping production, there was no chance that we were going to have an award session during the pandemic. But this is where I wondered how the Academy Awards actually worked. Upon reading up on [Preferential Ballot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_voting), what I wanted to know were the features that were subconsciously contributing to a movie being selected. And that's how I went ahead and thought of making this project.

## Data

The data used in this project was obtained from varrious publicly avalaible websites which are listed below. 

The list of movies that were either nominated or won the Oscar's best picture award was scraped from [Oscars Best Picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture)

Dataset of other movies was obtained from [IMDB Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows)

Any missing information in the above two datasets was obtained using [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/)
